# AI For Accountability - Part 1: CRA T3010 Charity Data Pipeline

**Hackathon: AI For Accountability** | April 29, 2026 | Government of Alberta

A complete, reproducible data pipeline that downloads, transforms, and loads **5 years of CRA T3010 charity disclosure data** (2020-2024) into PostgreSQL for AI-driven accountability analysis.

---

## What's In This Dataset

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total rows loaded** | 7,338,550 |
| **Fiscal years** | 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 |
| **Registered charities per year** | ~72,000 - 85,000 |
| **Dataset categories** | 19 per year (93 total, some years missing disbursement_quota) |
| **Database tables** | 35 (6 lookup + 19 data + 10 analysis) + 3 views |
| **Data source** | Canada Revenue Agency T3010 via Government of Canada Open Data API |

### Important Note on 2024 Data

The 2024 dataset represents a **partial year**. CRA requires charities to file within 6 months of their fiscal year end. Charities with December 31, 2024 year-ends have until June 30, 2025 to file. The 2024 data contains 71,954 identification records vs ~84,000 in prior complete years. The Dec 31 year-end cohort (the largest group) shows 37,693 filings in 2024 vs ~48,500 in complete years - consistent with a filing lag, not data loss. A refresh of the 2024 data will be requested from the Government of Canada as filings complete.

The 2024 data was also filed on a **revised T3010 form** (Version 24, released January 8, 2024), which added new fields (donor advised funds, impact investments, asset breakdowns) and removed deprecated fields. Our schema captures the union of all form versions - NULLs where a field doesn't exist for a given year. See [DATA_DICTIONARY.md](docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md) for details.

## Database Access

This project uses a two-tier access model:

| File | Committed to Repo? | Access Level | Who Uses It |
|------|:------------------:|-------------|------------|
| `.env.public` | Yes | **Read-only** (SELECT only) | Hackathon participants, AI agents |
| `.env` | No (gitignored) | **Full admin** (read/write) | Data pipeline operators |

**Participants:** The repo ships with `.env.public` containing read-only credentials. After `npm install`, you can immediately query 7.3M rows of charity data. No setup or data loading required.

**Administrators:** Use `.env` with admin credentials to load data or manage the schema. To rotate the read-only credentials:
```bash
npm run readonly:revoke    # Terminates sessions, drops user, deletes .env.public
npm run readonly:create    # Creates new user with fresh password, writes .env.public
```

The `lib/db.js` module loads `.env` first. If no `.env` exists, it falls back to `.env.public` automatically.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **PostgreSQL** database (connection string in `.env`)

### Option A: Full Pipeline (download + load everything)

```bash
npm install
npm run setup            # Runs: migrate → seed → fetch → import → verify
```

Or step by step:

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate          # Creates cra schema, 6 lookup + 19 data + 10 analysis tables + 3 views
npm run seed             # Load 620 lookup rows
npm run fetch            # Download 2020-2024 from Government of Canada Open Data API (93 datasets)
npm run import           # Load cached JSON into PostgreSQL (7,338,550 rows)
npm run verify           # Run 195 verification checks
```

To tear down and rebuild:

```bash
npm run reset            # Runs: drop → setup
```

### Option B: Use the Pre-Loaded Database (read-only)

A read-only connection is provided in `.env.public`. No setup required - just query:

```bash
npm install
# .env.public is included in the repo with read-only credentials
node -e "const db = require('./lib/db'); db.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cra_identification').then(r => { console.log(r.rows[0]); db.end(); })"
```

The `lib/db.js` module automatically falls back to `.env.public` if no `.env` file exists. This means hackathon participants can clone the repo, run `npm install`, and immediately query the database or run the analysis scripts.

## Pipeline Commands

All data for all five fiscal years (2020-2024) loads through a single unified pipeline using the Government of Canada Open Data API.

```bash
npm run fetch            # Downloads via CKAN datastore_search API
npm run import           # Loads cached JSON into PostgreSQL
```

- **Source**: `https://open.canada.ca/data/en/api/3/action/datastore_search`
- **Pagination**: 10,000 records per page, automatic offset tracking
- **Retry**: 5 attempts with exponential backoff (2s - 32s)
- **Caching**: Downloaded data saved as JSON in `data/cache/{year}/`
- **UUID Registry**: `config/datasets.js` maps 93 dataset/year combinations to API resource IDs
- **Per-year control**: `npm run fetch:2020`, `npm run import:2023`, etc.

## Checks and Balances

### Verification Pipeline

Every data load is verified for completeness and integrity:

| Check | What It Verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| API source count | Fetched records == API's reported total |
| DB row count | Database rows match fetched records (1% tolerance for invalid rows) |
| Balance report | Side-by-side: API Total / Fetched / DB Rows for all 93 datasets |
| Data quality | BN format (15 chars), designation values (A/B/C), province codes (2 chars) |
| Cross-year | All fiscal years present, financial data spans multiple FPE years |
| Unit tests | Transformers, cache I/O, UUID validation, dataset config |
| Integration tests | Schema existence, lookup population, row counts, data quality |

### Idempotency Guarantees

| Operation | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Schema creation | `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` |
| Lookup seeding | `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` |
| Data import | `INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` |
| Cache | Skips datasets already downloaded |

### Results Achieved

- 93/93 datasets fetched and imported
- 7,338,550 total rows loaded
- 195/195 verification checks passed

---

## Downloading Data

Export any table as CSV or JSON, optionally filtered by fiscal year:

```bash
# Download all tables, all years, as CSV
npm run download

# Download just 2024 data
npm run download -- --year 2024

# Download as JSON
npm run download -- --year 2023 --format json

# Download a single table
npm run download -- --table cra_directors --year 2024 --format csv
```

Files are saved to `data/downloads/` (gitignored). Works with the read-only `.env.public` credentials.

---

## Database Schema

All CRA tables live in the `cra` schema. The connection's `search_path` includes `cra`, so queries work with or without the schema prefix:

```sql
-- Both of these work:
SELECT * FROM cra_identification WHERE fiscal_year = 2024;
SELECT * FROM cra.cra_identification WHERE fiscal_year = 2024;
```

This namespacing keeps CRA data separate from other datasets that may be added in the future.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **BN** | Business Number: `870814944RR0001` (9 digits + RR + 4-digit program #) |
| **FPE** | Fiscal Period End: the date when a charity's fiscal year ends |
| **Form ID** | CRA internal version (23-27). Form ID 27 = 2024 T3010 revision |
| **field_XXXX** | Maps directly to T3010 line numbers (see T4033 guide) |
| **Designation** | A = Public Foundation, B = Private Foundation, C = Charitable Organization |
| **DECIMAL(18,2)** | All financial fields use this precision to handle outlier values |

### Data Tables

### Useful Queries

```sql
-- Search charities by name
SELECT bn, legal_name, city, province, designation
FROM cra_identification
WHERE legal_name ILIKE '%search term%' AND fiscal_year = 2024;

-- Revenue trends for a charity across 5 years
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fpe) AS year, field_4700 AS revenue,
       field_5100 AS expenditures, field_4200 AS assets
FROM cra_financial_details
WHERE bn = '123456789RR0001'
ORDER BY fpe;

-- Top 20 charities by revenue (latest year)
SELECT ci.legal_name, fd.field_4700 AS revenue
FROM cra_financial_details fd
JOIN cra_identification ci ON fd.bn = ci.bn AND ci.fiscal_year = 2023
WHERE fd.fpe >= '2023-01-01' AND fd.fpe <= '2023-12-31'
ORDER BY fd.field_4700 DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 20;

-- Directors serving on multiple charities (network analysis)
SELECT last_name, first_name, COUNT(DISTINCT bn) AS charities
FROM cra_directors
WHERE fpe >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY last_name, first_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT bn) > 5
ORDER BY charities DESC;

-- Charities with international spending
SELECT ci.legal_name, aod.field_200 AS intl_spending
FROM cra_activities_outside_details aod
JOIN cra_identification ci ON aod.bn = ci.bn AND ci.fiscal_year = 2024
WHERE aod.fpe >= '2024-01-01' AND aod.field_200 > 0
ORDER BY aod.field_200 DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## Advanced Analysis: Circular Gifting Detection

The `scripts/advanced/` directory contains a multi-method pipeline for detecting circular funding patterns, stored in database tables for direct SQL querying.

### Quick Start

```bash
npm run analyze:all          # Full pipeline: loops + scc + partitioned + score
```

Or individually:

```bash
npm run analyze:loops        # Brute force: pruned self-join, 2-6 hops (~2 hours for 6-hop)
npm run analyze:scc          # SCC decomposition: structural analysis (<1 sec)
npm run analyze:partitioned  # Partitioned: SCC-partitioned Johnson's (~14 sec)
npm run analyze:score        # Risk scoring: 0-30 score for each charity (~45 min)
```

Supplementary cross-validation scripts (not included in `analyze:all`):

```bash
node scripts/advanced/06-johnson-cycles.js --max-hops 5    # Johnson's on full graph
node scripts/advanced/04-matrix-power-census.js             # Walk census via matrix powers
```

### Scripts

| # | Script | What It Does | Speed |
|---|--------|-------------|-------|
| 01 | `01-detect-all-loops.js` | **Primary.** Iterative dead-end pruning (237K to ~54K edges), then N-way self-joins per hop. Temporal constraint (year window +/-1). Ground truth results. | 2-5 hop: ~6 min. 6-hop: ~2 hours |
| 02 | `02-score-universe.js` | Risk scoring: circular + financial + temporal factors for every charity in a loop. Reads from `cra.loop_participants`. | ~45 min |
| 03 | `03-scc-decomposition.js` | Tarjan's SCC. Shows network structure: 1 giant SCC (8,971 nodes, mostly denominational) + 338 small SCCs. | <1 sec |
| 04 | `04-matrix-power-census.js` | Closed-walk census via matrix powers. Cross-validation diagnostic. Counts walks (not simple cycles). | ~3.5 min |
| 05 | `05-partitioned-cycles.js` | Johnson's algorithm per SCC. Small SCCs get full enumeration. Giant SCC gets hub removal + fragmentation. Fast but misses ~40% of cycles routing through hubs. | ~14 sec |
| 06 | `06-johnson-cycles.js` | Johnson's on full graph. Works at depth <=5. Chokes on giant SCC at depth 8. Use `--max-hops 5`. | Varies |

### How They Relate

- **01 (brute force)** is the ground truth. Every cycle it finds is a verified, non-redundant, temporally-constrained simple cycle. Use this for authoritative results.
- **05 (partitioned)** is the fast complement. It finds ~60% of what 01 finds in 14 seconds. The missing ~40% are cycles that route through mega-hub platforms (CanadaHelps, Watch Tower, etc.).
- **03 (SCC)** tells you the shape: one giant interconnected component (8,971 nodes, mostly JW denominational + DAF platforms) and 338 small clusters of 2-50 nodes.
- **02 (scoring)** runs after 01 completes. Reads `cra.loop_participants` to score each charity.

### Analysis Tables

All results stored in the `cra` schema (queryable by hackathon participants):

| Table | Rows | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `loop_edges` | ~54,000 | Pruned gift edge graph (threshold + dead-end removal) |
| `loops` | 5,808 | Detected cycles (brute force ground truth) |
| `loop_participants` | 30,003 | Per-charity cycle membership with send/receive partners |
| `loop_universe` | 1,501 | Per-charity aggregate stats and risk scores |
| `scc_components` | 10,177 | Which SCC each charity belongs to |
| `scc_summary` | 347 | Per-SCC statistics |
| `partitioned_cycles` | 108 | Cycles from SCC-partitioned Johnson's |
| `identified_hubs` | 20 | Mega-hub platforms identified in the giant SCC |
| `johnson_cycles` | 2,128 | Johnson's algorithm results (cross-validation) |
| `matrix_census` | 10,177 | Walk census results (cross-validation) |

### CLI Options

```bash
# Brute force with custom threshold and year window
node scripts/advanced/01-detect-all-loops.js --threshold 10000 --max-hops 6 --year-window 0

# Partitioned with no hub removal (gets more cycles but slower)
node scripts/advanced/05-partitioned-cycles.js --tier2-threshold 5000 --no-hub-removal

# Johnson's capped at depth 5 (practical limit)
node scripts/advanced/06-johnson-cycles.js --max-hops 5
```

### Risk Score (0-30)

| Category | Max | Factors |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Circular** | 6 | Reciprocal giving, multiple cycles, multi-year, large amounts, shared directors, CRA associated flag |
| **Financial** | 12 | High overhead (>40%), charity-funded (>50%), pass-through, low programs (<20%), compensation > programs, circular >> programs |
| **Temporal** | 12 | Same-year round-trips across all hop sizes (0-4), adjacent-year round-trips (0-4), persistent multi-year patterns (0-2), multi-hop temporal completion (0-2) |

Temporal scoring covers all cycle sizes (2-6 hop), not just direct 2-hop exchanges. For each cycle a charity participates in, it checks whether money sent to the next hop came back from the previous hop within the same fiscal year or N+1. This catches both direct reciprocation and multi-hop round-tripping.

### Interactive Deep Dives

```bash
# Look up a charity's full network
npm run lookup -- --name "charity name"
npm run lookup -- --bn 123456789RR0001
npm run lookup -- --name "charity name" --hops 5

# Generate a risk report for a specific charity
npm run risk -- --name "some charity"
npm run risk -- --bn 123456789RR0001
```

**Lookup** shows: outgoing/incoming gifts, reciprocal flows, 3-6 hop loops, shared directors.
Files saved: `data/reports/lookup-{BN}.json` + `lookup-{BN}.txt`

**Risk report** shows: scored risk factors, multi-year financials, same-year symmetric flows, adjacent-year round-trips, shared directors.
Files saved: `data/reports/risk-{BN}.json` + `risk-{BN}.md`

### Generated Reports (`data/reports/`)

| File | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `universe-scored.json` | Scoring | Full scored results for every charity |
| `universe-scored.csv` | Scoring | Flat file for analysis tools (Excel, Python, R) |
| `universe-top50.txt` | Scoring | Human-readable top 50 with all factors |
| `lookup-{BN}.*` | Lookup | Per-charity network analysis |
| `risk-{BN}.*` | Risk | Per-charity risk report with financials |

---

## AI Agent Integration

This project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file and skill definitions in `.claude/skills/` that enable AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, etc.) to perform deep analytical profiling on the dataset.

### Available Skills

| Skill | File | What It Does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Profile Charity** | `.claude/skills/profile-charity.md` | Full profiling workflow: risk score, network, year-by-year flows, charity type assessment |
| **Detect Circular Patterns** | `.claude/skills/detect-circular-patterns.md` | Run and interpret the full analysis pipeline |
| **Compare Charities** | `.claude/skills/compare-charities.md` | Side-by-side financial and risk comparison |
| **Analyze Network** | `.claude/skills/analyze-network.md` | Map gift-flow network, identify clusters and hubs |
| **Temporal Flow Analysis** | `.claude/skills/temporal-flow-analysis.md` | Same-year and adjacent-year symmetric flow analysis |

### Using with an AI Agent

Open the project in Claude Code or any agent-enabled IDE. The agent will read `CLAUDE.md` for context and can follow the skill workflows to profile charities, interpret scoring, and produce evidence-backed findings. Example prompts:

- "Profile the charity with BN 123456789RR0001"
- "Run the circular pattern detection and show me the top results"
- "Compare these three charities on financial metrics and circular risk"
- "Analyze the gift network around this charity"
- "Show me the year-by-year timing of flows between these two charities"

The `CLAUDE.md` also documents the complete analytical methodology developed during the original analysis, including the five-phase approach (identify universe, triage by charity type, deep dive, temporal analysis, contextual validation).

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Node.js only** | Matches existing codebase; single language for entire pipeline |
| **No ORM** | Direct SQL for transparency; hackathon participants can read every query |
| **Local JSON cache** | Avoids repeated API calls; enables offline re-import |
| **Batch INSERT (1,000 rows)** | Balances throughput vs. query size limits over network to Render |
| **ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING** | Idempotent imports - safe to re-run without duplicates |
| **Additive schema** | Union of all form versions; NULL for fields not in a given version |
| **fiscal_year on identification** | API identification data has no FPE; fiscal_year enables multi-year |
| **snake_case table names** | Industry standard; matches Phase 3 visualization schema |
| **DECIMAL(18,2)** | Financial fields need precision to handle outlier values |
| **Consolidated migration** | Single `01-migrate.js` creates everything including analysis tables |
| **Unified API pipeline** | All 5 years (including 2024) load through the same API pathway |

---

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests (no database needed)
npm run test:integration    # Schema + data verification (requires database)
npm run verify              # 195 verification checks across all years
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| API timeout during fetch | Cached data preserved; re-run `npm run fetch` to resume |
| Import fails midway | Re-run the import - idempotent, skips existing rows |
| Missing 2024 data | This is partial-year data; not all charities have filed yet |
| Schema mismatch | Run `npm run migrate` to bring schema up to date |
| Permission denied on queries | You're using the read-only account; this is expected for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE |
| Need to rotate credentials | Admin runs `npm run readonly:revoke && npm run readonly:create` |
| No DB_CONNECTION_STRING | Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (admin) or use `.env.public` (read-only) |
